# Frontend-library-project
This is the first frontend project I built using Redux and typescript, the app can be run standalone but will be later integrated with the backend. This web app is a book library in which users can login, search,filter and scroll for books to borrow or return, the admin can add, update, delete the books and authors. 

## To run the project
- cd <into the project folder>
- npm install
- npm run dev

## Link to the webapp
